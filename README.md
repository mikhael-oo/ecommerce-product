## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Hooks like useReducer, useContext, and useState



### What I learned

I learned complex state management using React Hooks like useReducer and useContext. Also, I learned how the workflow of adding functionalities like cart update, addition, and removal works overall using React.

### Continued development

In my next project, I want to add using CSS Libraries like Tailwind to design, and a backend with Express to simulate a complete ecommerce site



### Useful resources

- [React docs](https://reactjs.org) - This helped me learn state management.
- [CSS Tricks](https://www.csstricks.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me build modals and style them.
